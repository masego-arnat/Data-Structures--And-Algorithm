# Data Structure Project

## Overview
This project implements various data structures and their operations. It is designed to provide a deep understanding of fundamental data structures and their practical applications.

## Features
- Implementation of common data structures:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
  - Stacks
  - Queues (Simple, Circular, and Priority)
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
  - Graphs
- Basic and advanced operations for each data structure.
- Optimized algorithms for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.
- Code examples and test cases for each implementation.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python/C++/Java (Choose based on your implementation)
- Development Tools: Any IDE or text editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Version Control: Git

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structure-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd data-structure-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python
   ```

## Usage
1. Run individual data structure implementations:
   ```sh
   python linked_list.py  # Example for Python
   ```
   ```sh
   g++ linked_list.cpp -o linked_list && ./linked_list  # Example for C++
   ```
2. Explore different test cases and modify implementations as needed.
