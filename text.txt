Complexity Analysis
Worst-Case Time Complexity of Huffman Coding
Building Frequency Map → O(n)
Building Huffman Tree → O(n log n)
Generating Codes → O(n)
Encoding Message → O(n)
Decoding Message → O(n)
Total Worst-Case Complexity: O(n log n) (due to priority queue operations).









using Huffman coding would reduce the size of the message before sending it over the network, making it more efficient and reducing bandwidth consumption. 
It could be especially helpful in scenarios with many clients exchanging large amounts of text data, as Huffman coding would minimize the overhead on each message sent.

In summary, Huffman coding is used primarily to reduce data size while preserving data integrity, and it is valuable in contexts where reducing transmission time, saving bandwidth, 
or conserving storage is essential.
